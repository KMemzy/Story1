# The Land of Dreams
## The Legend of the Dreamer
The legend is told as such: Long ago, a ship came exploring from the mainland. There lay but one survivor, a slave with no name. The man roamed this new land, searching for people. Nothing could he find but the untamed wilderness. Within a secluded corner of the forest, he found a great ::TREE SPECIES TBD:: tree set ablaze. But strangely, the wood did not turn to ash. He came closer to it, and realized he too did not burn from the fire's touch. He felt a stange sensation come over him as he set his back to it and sat at the base of the tree's trunk. He lulled into a deep slumber. And from his mind sprang forth the people of ::THE LAND OF DREAMS, TRUE NAME TBD::. Some say that if the tree were to be found, and the dreamer woken, the ::ETHNICITY NAME TBD:: would surely end.

## The Dreamers
A cult dedicated to sedative drugs processed from the plants native to the island. They strive to enter a state of "half-death", in which they live forever, in the realm of Dreamers. They once were a great power on the island, for they kept their vast knowledge on drugs, sciences, and medicines secret. Now they merely lurk in the shadowy areas of the cities, were they've earned themselves the title of "Dealers", as they sell drugs they learnt to make from their holy books for petty cash. They too are a shadow of the island's history.
